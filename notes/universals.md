<li>In declarative sentences with nominal subject and object, the dominant order is almost always one in which the subject precedes the object.</li>
<li>In languages with prepositions, the genitive almost always follows the governing noun, while in languages with postpositions it almost always precedes.</li>
<li>Languages with dominant VSO order are always prepositional.</li>
<li>With overwhelmingly greater than chance frequency, languages with normal SOV order are postpositional.</li>
<li>If a language has dominant SOV order and the genitive follows the governing noun, then the adjective likewise follows the noun.</li>
<li>All languages with dominant VSO order have SVO as an alternative or as the only alternative basic order.</li>
